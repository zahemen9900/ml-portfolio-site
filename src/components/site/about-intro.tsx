            <p>
              During my time at <strong>KNUST</strong>, I majored in software engineering, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurityâ€”disciplines that challenged me to ship reliable systems as often as I explore new research.
            </p>
            <p>
              That curiosity has taken me from transformer experiments in campus labs to hackathons, internships, and community projects. Along the way, I&apos;ve learned that the most meaningful AI experiences are both technically rigorous and deeply human.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, I focus on building products that bridge intelligence and usability: copilots that make financial insights clearer, knowledge engines that help researchers ask better questions, and learning tools that adapt to each person.
