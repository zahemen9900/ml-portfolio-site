## 🚀 BioQuery Project Page — Draft Layout & Content Plan

> **Note:** This is a draft document detailing the layout, motion, and storytelling flow for the **BioQuery** project sub-page. The design follows the global Projects Page layout, featuring seamless transitions, cinematic visuals, and interactive storytelling.

---

### 🪐 **Hero Section — Project Overview**

**Goal:** Make the first impression powerful, intelligent, and inspiring — reflecting BioQuery’s scientific and AI-driven mission.

**Layout:**

* Full-width hero section with looping background video or short animation (e.g., visualization of data or starfield fade-in).
* Prominent title: **“BioQuery: AI-Powered Space Biology Knowledge Engine”**
* Subtext: *Exploring how life adapts beyond Earth through intelligent search.*
* Call-to-Action buttons: [Visit BioQuery] [View NASA Challenge]

**Motion & Visuals:**

* Framer Motion fade-up + blur entrance for hero text.
* Hero video starts muted, looping with soft gradient overlay.
* Slight parallax on scroll to add depth.

### 🧠 **Introduction & Story Section**

**Purpose:** Introduce BioQuery’s context and motivation clearly.

> **BioQuery** was built for the 2025 NASA Space Apps Challenge (Kumasi) — a global hackathon uniting innovators to tackle challenges from space exploration. Our team, *Astro-Voyagers*, created BioQuery to transform over **600 NASA bioscience publications** into an **AI-powered research engine** that helps scientists and mission planners ask natural questions and discover insights about how life adapts beyond Earth.

**Transition:** Text fades in from left; supporting image (NASA/space visual) slides in from right.

**Visual Enhancement:**

* Optional small clip showing team at work (muted autoplay, fade-on-scroll).
* Light scroll-triggered animations with subtle delays for readability.

### 🌌 **Feature Highlight Sections (3 Key Features)**

Each feature block alternates between text and media layout (to the left and right). Each one scrolls into view with staggered fade + motion.

#### **1. Natural Language Research Engine + Web Search**

* **Description:**

  > BioQuery uses advanced **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to allow natural language queries. Researchers can ask complex biology-related questions and get AI-generated insights grounded in NASA’s scientific corpus.
* **Visual:** Screen recording (or simulated demo) showing a user typing a question and BioQuery responding.
* **Motion:** Slide-up + fade-in animation; video autoplay when visible.

#### **2. Cohere Embeddings + Knowledge Graphs**

* **Description:**

  > Combining **Cohere embeddings** with graph-based relationships, BioQuery connects related publications, enabling scientists to visualize connections between biological research findings and space mission outcomes.
* **Visual:** Animated network graph or GIF demonstrating related topics expanding.
* **Motion:** Slide from right, nodes pulse gently when in view.

#### **3. Interactive & Scalable Web Interface**

* **Description:**

  > Built on **Next.js** and **Vercel** with agentic capabilities baked in, the web app delivers real-time responses and interactive data exploration through many explorative features, encouraging scientific curiosity through minimalism, clarity, and motion.
* **Visual:** Clip of the web interface with the several features like image-gen, timelines, research docs; hover interactions and search flow.
* **Motion:** Fade-up with slight zoom-in on hover.

### 🏆 **Impact Section — Recognition & Achievements**

> BioQuery won the **Galactic Impact Award** at NASA Space Apps Kumasi 2025 — an honor celebrating projects with the potential to advance humanity’s exploration of space.

**Visual Elements:**

* Photo of the team receiving recognition (or trophy shot)/ a sleek award trophy icon from shadcn.
* NASA Space Apps logo subtly watermarked.

**Animation:**

* Soft glow animation around the award card.
* Text fade-up with scroll-trigger.

**Metrics (Optional Animated Counters):**

* `600+` NASA bioscience publications analyzed.
* `3 Days` to prototype and deploy.
* `2` core AI components (RAG + KG) fully integrated.

### 🎬 **Behind the Scenes / Reflection**

> “BioQuery reminded me how far you can go in a weekend when passion meets purpose. It’s more than a hackathon project — it’s a vision of how AI can accelerate discovery beyond Earth.”

**Transition:** Typewriter text animation on the reflection quote.

**Optional Add-on:** Mini photo gallery (team moments, coding snapshots) in a ShadCN modal carousel.

---

### 🔄 **Navigation & Transitions**

* **Entry:** Shared element transition from the BioQuery project card (image/video expands into hero).
* **Exit:** Reverse transition collapsing back into the main Projects page.
* **Scroll Behavior:** Smooth scroll with parallax background for atmospheric depth.

---

### 🧠 **Design & Aesthetic Notes**

* Promote a sense of discovery and depth (space/AI fusion aesthetic).
* Use gradient overlays subtly inspired by cosmic colors (within blue-centric site theme).
* Typography: Modern, readable, with clear hierarchy.
* Maintain accessibility: legible contrasts, motion sensitivity settings.

---

### ✅ **Summary**

The **BioQuery** project sub-page will function as an immersive showcase — merging storytelling, scientific impact, and elegant interaction. Through cinematic view transitions, alternating layouts, and thoughtful motion, it captures the essence of AI innovation meeting human curiosity.

> *End of Draft — ready for refinement and visual design alignment.*
